## Hi, I'm mlomics, but you can call me Penguin.

I'm a computational biologist and data scientist focused on modeling biological systems through medical imaging, omics data, and clinical records. At a clinical institution, I develop imaging-based decision support tools using CT and CBCT data, integrating DICOM workflows and surface mapping techniques to support adaptive radiotherapy.

My background includes epigenomics, transcriptomics, CRISPR screening, chromosome conformation analysis, and integrative bioinformatics in cancer biology. I'm particularly interested in developing generalizable frameworks to analyze biological systems across multiple data types, with applications in aging, treatment response, and systems modeling.

## Areas of Focus

- Medical imaging and segmented surface/dose prediction
- DICOM automation and CT/CBCT data processing  
- Clinical decision support workflows  
- Epigenomics, transcriptomics, and CRISPR integrative analysis
- Data integration and system-level modeling

## Technical Tools

Python, R, Bash, SQL, Flask, Pandas, XGBoost, PyTorch, Snakemake, ARIA, DICOM toolkits

Location: United States  
Open to: Collaborations in computational biology or medical imaging analysis, translational research, and integrative modeling
